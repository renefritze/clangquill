# Installation

## Stable release

To install clangquill, run this command in your terminal:

```{code-block} bash

uv pip install clangquill

```

This is the preferred method to install clangquill, as it will always install the most recent stable release.
Plain `pip install clangquill` works just as well if you prefer.

If you don't have [uv][uv] installed, the [uv installation guide][uv installation guide] can guide
you through the process.

```{note}
**Bundled libclang.** The Linux wheels bundle a self-contained **libclang 22**
(from the official LLVM release), so parsing works out of the box with no system
LLVM required — `c++20`/`c++23`/`c++26` are all supported (see the
[`std` configuration note](guides/configuration.md)). Because that libclang
needs **glibc ≥ 2.34** (manylinux_2_34), the wheels install on reasonably recent
Linux distributions; on older systems, build from source against your own
libclang instead.
